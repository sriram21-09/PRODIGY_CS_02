Image Encryption Tool using Pixel Manipulation

Concept: Encrypting and decrypting images by modifying the pixel values.

How it works: You can manipulate each pixel's value using mathematical operations or swaps.

Mathematical Operations: Adding or subtracting a fixed number (key) to/from each pixel value.

Swapping Pixels: Changing pixel positions according to a specific algorithm or pattern.

Steps:

Read the Image: Convert the image into a numerical array.

Encrypt: Apply the chosen manipulation method (like addition).

Decrypt: Reverse the manipulation (like subtraction).

Save the Results: Store the encrypted and decrypted images.

This technique allows users to secure their images with a relatively simple method, though it's not as secure as modern encryption algorithms.
